		<p>For this assignment we had to use our knowledge of radio buttons, checkboxes, text fields and java script to code a quiz on a website that would add up the marks from the quiz and display an answer. Unlike everyone else I didn't do a "right" or "wrong" quiz. I did a "which music teacher are you?" quiz.</p></div><div id="frame"><iframe class="frame" src="quiz/quiz.html" height="550px" width="100%" ></iframe></div>

		<ul>
			<li>What was the purpose of the assignment?</li>
			<p>The purpose of the assignment was to use our new found knowledge of java script, radio buttons, text fields, and check boxes in a interactable quiz.</p>
			<li>What did I like about the assignment?</li>
			<p>Personally, I really liked learning how to make a quiz using java script, i found it neat so i really enjoyed how the assignment taught me how to do it.</p>
			<li>What did I find Difficult about the assignment?</li>
			<p>The java script was difficult in this assignment becuase if your java script stopped working you would have to find the source of the problem which took a while and also you would have to look up how to do certain things on java script.</p>
			<li>If I were to change the assignment, how could I change it?</li>
			<p>I loved this assignment so much that I would not change it. The only thing I would maybe change is the (again) choice in what kind of quiz to make.</p>
