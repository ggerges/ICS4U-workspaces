		<p>In light of an upcoming holiday, we were assigned to use our photoshopping skills to make a "Halloween" themed scavenger hunt on photoshop. Our task was to place 31 objects in the photo, 16 that the player is required to find and 15 that is strategically placed to throw the user off. </p></div><img id="halloween" src="images/halloween.jpg">

		<ul>
			<li>What was the purpose of the assignment?</li>
			<p>I think the purpose of the assignment was to put our photoshop skills to the test in creating a scavenger hunt that pushes our skills of opacity, and the transform tool and all sorts of other tools to hide our objects.</p>
			<li>What did I like about the assignment?</li>
			<p>I liked how there was a wide range of options for you to do, it didnt limit your creativity besides the fact that it had to be halloween themed.</p>
			<li>What did I find Difficult about the assignment?</li>
			<p>I found adding 31 items to the photo really difficult becuase you had to find items that were relevent to the theme and at the same time hide them.</p>
			<li>If I were to change the assignment, how I change it?</li>
			<p>I personally enjoyed the assignment, I wouldn't change it. Maybe just cut down the number of things to hide.</p>
