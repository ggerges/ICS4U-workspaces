		<div id="Content1"><h1>Website using Photoshop</h1>
		<p>In this assignment, we were told to build a website for a company on Photoshop. This was the final Assignment for the photoshop unit so students were ready to put forth all their knowledge from the unit and into the assignment. For this project we also had to use the design process learned in Unit 1.</p></div><img id="website" src="images/website.jpg">
		<div id="Questions"><h1>Questions</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>What was the purpose of the assignment?</li>
			<p>I think the purpose of the assignment was to apply all our skills in what we learned throughout the unit to make a website at the same time introducing building websites. This was the final project of photoshop so i think it was meant to combine everything we learnt into one project.</p>
			<li>What did I like about the assignment?</li>
			<p>I liked how we were free to choose which company to do and we could also be creative with the website we had to make.</p>
			<li>What did I find Difficult about the assignment?</li>
			<p>I found the initial layout of the website difficult, with the navigation bar being a certain height and using guide lines.</p>
			<li>If I were to change the assignment, how could I change it?</li>
			<p>I personally wouldn't change the assignment.</p>
