		<ul>
			<li>What was the purpose of the assignment?</li>
			<p>I think the purpose of the Assignment was to get students framilier with using CSS and HTML with their own creativity.</p>
			<li>What did I like about the assignment?</li>
			<p>I liked the assignment overall mainly because I enjoyed coding with HTML and CSS so much compared to the other units we did throughout the year.</p>
			<li>What did I find Difficult about the assignment?</li>
			<p>I found putting my ideas in my head on what I wanted the webpage to look like and the putting it into CSS difficult.</p>
			<li>If I were to change the assignment, how I change it?</li>
			<p>I would change the limitations to what the webpage could be. I think it would be more enjoyable if students could choose what their website was about.</p>
